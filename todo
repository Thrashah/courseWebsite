* better front page, i want a relaxing view, drone photo of the course perhaps, with the minimalist logo added at top middle
* tee times should be a simple two column, 40 rows. work on dyanmic of it later.
* grill menu should just be a pdf simply.
* event calendar should look good with a small list of what happening in the month and next month. Calendar then few rows of events. with a "more" option to entail what will happen during the event, what the public can do.
* range-status should give live updates timestamped on what's going on, "mats only" "irons only" open, closed, and so on. then prices of range balls.
* better roadmap.
